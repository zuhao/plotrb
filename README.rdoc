== Description

Plotrb is an experimental plotting library for the Ruby language. It
brings {the simplicity of Vega}[http://trifacta.github.io/vega/] and
{the power of D3}[http://d3js.org/] to the Ruby science community, to
allow for {fast, customizable design; reusability and shareability; programmatic generation of visualizations; and improved performance and platform flexibility}[https://github.com/trifacta/vega/wiki/Vega-and-D3].

Plotrb is in many ways the child of
{Rubyvis}[http://github.com/SciRuby/rubyvis] (the Ruby port of
Protovis). However, it improves upon Rubyvis in that it uses a DSL that
will be much more familiar and natural to Ruby coders.

Plotrb was created by Wan Zuhao as part of Google's Summer of Code 2013.
It is part of {SciRuby}[http://sciruby.com].

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'plotrb'

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    gem install plotrb
